# Giphy Search Engine

This project is a simple giphy search engine designed to allow lookup and copy urls of gifs, as well as demonstrate javascript knowledge!

## Overview

This `giphy-search-engine` is a javascript project that uses my giphy API key to dynamically fetch gif urls and display them to the dom. This project provides detailed examples of general javascript knowledge, promise/fetch knowledge, general HTML/CSS, and more.

## Key Features

- **Gif Search Functionality**: Users can seach for GIFs by typing in words and through the giphy API, the search results are dynamically displayed in a flex grid format, which provides a smooth user experience.
-**Pagination System**: This project uses a pagination system that allows users to navigate forwards and backwards through multiple pages of GIF search results.
-**Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive and adjust to different screen sizes (mobile and desktop). The layout changes from multiple columns on the larger screen, to one column on smaller screens for optimal viewing experience for all sizes.
-**Modal Pop-up**: Clicking on any loaded Gif results in a modal pop up over the screen with the selected GIF in a larger view.
-**Clipboard URL Copying**: Within the modal, there is a copy URL button which will copy the GIFs url directly to their clipboard with a single click, as well as alerting the user that the url was copied.
-**Quiz Feature**: This application also includes a mini quiz game where users try to guess the movie from the GIFs. This feature is implemented with dynamic content generating and scoring, making it engaging and fun for users.
